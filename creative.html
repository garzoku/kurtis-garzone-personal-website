                <p>
                    As a writer of fiction, I have written countless stories.
                     Most of them end up in a waste basket while some go on to become completed works that I can feel proud of.
                      Every story starts with an idea, and the inherent problem with this is that, at first, every idea seems like a good one.
                       I've developed a 6-step process for writing that helps me sort the good stories from the bad ones. Here it is.

                                write the first draft and do not pause to go back and read it—No matter how tempted you may be!</div>
