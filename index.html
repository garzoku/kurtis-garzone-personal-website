                        My life has been a curious juggling act of interests and hobbies. 
                        Currently, I'm a Dealer Service Analyst at Ford Motor Credit Company, 
                        the financial services arm of Ford Motor Company. I'm also a published author of short fiction. 
                        In 2019, my short story “Don't Go in the Shed” was featured in the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50251405-leading-edge-issue-75" target="_blank">Leading Edge Anthology</a>, 
                        a quarterly collection of science fiction and fantasy stories published by Brigham Young University.

                        I want to be a software engineer because it's one of the most versatile occupations of the modern world.
                        As an author, I can only imagine fictional stories and then describe those stories in words.
                         But there are many other forms of creative expression that can only be achieved through the collaboration of software engineers and other creative thinkers.
                          There's a reason why the greatest software engineers are referred to as Wizards. And let's be honest: Who wouldn't want to be a wizard?
